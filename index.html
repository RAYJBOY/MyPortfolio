<!--------------------------------------ABOUT ME------------------------------->
    <div class="sub-heading">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Having achieved a first-class Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering at the University of Leeds, I have been exposed to a plethora of technologies over the past few years. From programing microcontrollers/FPGAs to exploring the cloud and building web pages, I have developed a well-rounded suite of skills in hardware and software which I strive to better everyday. I am currently working at DAI as a software engineer (mostly in the C programming language), where I am responsible for testing (using Python's "behave" framework). Additionally, I have experience with crucial skills that are necessary in industry like version control. I work well in a team where everyone can collaborate and share their experiences, while at the same time ensuring I meet all my targets. As a curious individual, I also love to undertake side projects where I can explore new technologies, this being a great example!</p>

            <p><h3>The Buggy Project</h3>In a team of 4, I managed to make a fully functioning remote-controlled buggy. It consisted of a remote control (with the transmitter), and the buggy chassis itself (which had the reciever and circuitry to control the buggy).</p>
