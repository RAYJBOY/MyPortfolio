      <h1>Library Management System</h1>
      <h2>Overview of Project</h2>
      <p>I successfully completed this project in the first year of university. It was one of the most fulfilling and challenging projects I had done. <br><br> The library management system allowed librarians and students to carry out common tasks of a library. The librarian could perform tasks like adding/removing books in the library, printing a list of all students/books in to the library and more. Students were able to perform tasks like searching for their desired books, borrowing/returning them and more. <br><br> As the project was relatively large, it was broken down into smaller functions, making the implementation easier. Project management was key to ensuring the project was completed before the deadline. At each milestone, the code was pushed to a remote repository (GitLab) to ensure the code was not lost. Additionally, unit testing (using the Unity framework) ensured the system functioned as expected. All parts of the system were tested with many types of input.</p>

      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <ul class="challenges">
        <li>Project looked too complex at start - the total time till the deadline was partitioned and the task broken into smaller parts. Each part was assigned a certain time to complete with additional contingency. The project was fit into the entirety of the time before the deadline, making each part as easy to implement as possible.</li>
        <li>Advanced concepts like file I/O and pointers were refreshed. These would come handy during the system implementation. Additionally, the design was made simple to ensure I could finish it. For example, the UI was a simple menu-driven interface rather than something more complex.</li>
        <li>Version control - a risk of losing work meant version control would be essential. Basic commands of Git were learned (push, pull, add, commit etc.)</li>
        <li>New to unit testing - to ensure the program functioned as expected, unit testing had to be adopted. This had to be learned during the implementation phase, meaning less time to implement the solution. Fortunately, I was quick to learn this and successfully implemented it as part of the project.</li>
      </ul>
